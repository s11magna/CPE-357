                                                    Assignment 4: sfind
Program Logic:
1. Get the commmand line arguments
2. Determine whether they contain the flags Delete and EXEC with an optinal command for EXEC
3. Also the flag -name will process all files that contain the substring
4. Excute the command for either print or EXEC

Functions:
int fileDescriptorCount();
 /*This could be a tree structure, but I am not completely sure if this would be the best course of action*/
struct Node fileDescriptor(node fileDescriptor); /*to avoid running out of fileDescriptors
void prtinf( char* fileName); 
void exec(argv, char fileName);
char* fileSearch(dir *File);

Error Testing: 
Check for spaces in the command line
files that don't exist
files that fail to execute
files that return no matches

Unit Testing
Test with different directory and depths
